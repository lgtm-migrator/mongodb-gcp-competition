# London MongoDB Atlas on GCP workshop competition

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/simonespa/mongodb-gcp-competition.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/simonespa/mongodb-gcp-competition) [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/simonespa/mongodb-gcp-competition?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

This is an open source proof of concept that integrates [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) with the [Google Cloud Platform APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis) as part of the [London MongoDB Atlas on GCP workshop](https://mdbgcp.splashthat.com) competition (November 27 2019 - Google London).

The web app is an ExpressJS server which uses the GCP Cloud Natural Language API to detect the language and extract the Wikipedia links of the core entities of the entered text and the Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate the audio version of it.

For performance reasons the response from both GCP APIs are stored in MongoDB Atlas which works as a caching layer. The ID of each entry is the SHA-256 fingerprint of the normalised version (lower case, stripped of all spaces) of the text itself. This makes sure that the same text is not analysed twice. Also, the web app makes use of a connection pool to communicate with MongoDB.

## Pre-requisites

- Have a GCP account
- Have the Cloud Natural Language and the Cloud Text-to-Speech APIs enabled
- Have "Service Account Key" credential generated
- Have a MongoDB Atlas account and a cluster deployed

Note: in development you could also use MongoDB Community Server which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community).

## Getting started

1. Create a "Service Account Key" credential in GCP as described [here](https://github.com/rbohan/MongoDBAtlas-GCP-AIMLv2/blob/master/Guides/GCPProjectAndVisionSetup.md)
2. Download the GCP credential to the root folder of the project, in a file named `gcpcreds.json`. Without doing so, you'll get the following error: `400 undefined: Getting metadata from plugin failed with error: invalid_grant: Robot is disabled.`
3. Export the following environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI`: the connection URI. If you use Atlas, you can get the URI by clicking the "connect" button of the Sandbox area by clicking on "Clusters" on the left-hand-side menu. If you use the Community server, the URI is `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?compressors=zlib&gssapiServiceName=mongodb`
- `MONGODB_DATABASE`: the database name
- `MONGODB_COLLECTION`: the collection name

4. Execute `npm install`
5. Execute `npm run watch` in development

To build the app for production, execute `npm run build` and then `npm start` to run it.

## Testing

The `@babel/register` dependency is because of the nature of ES6 modules. If we want to run babel without a build step like webpack or rollup, and run babel "on the fly", we need to register Babel into Node runtime. The require hook will bind itself to Nodeâ€™s require and automatically compile files on the fly.
